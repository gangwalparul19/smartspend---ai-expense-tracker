## 🔐 Environment Variables

### Freemium BYOK Model

This app uses a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model for AI features:

- ✅ **Core features work without any API key**
- ✅ **Users add their own Gemini API keys** (stored locally in browser)
- ✅ **Perfect for commercial use** - each user uses their own free quota
- ✅ **Privacy-first** - API keys never leave the user's browser

**No server-side environment variables needed!** Users configure their own API keys through the Settings page in the app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The old `.env.local` approach is no longer used. API keys are now managed per-user within the app.

---

## 💰 Commercial Use & Scaling

### Freemium Hybrid Architecture

This app is designed to **scale commercially** without incurring API costs:

**How it works:**
- Core expense tracking features are **100% free**
- AI features are **optional** and require user's own API key
- Each user stays within **their own** Gemini API free tier (1,500 requests/day)
- **Zero cost to you**, even with thousands of users!

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No backend infrastructure needed
- ✅ No API quota concerns
- ✅ Privacy-first (keys never sent to your server)
- ✅ Free forever for all users

**Future Monetization (Optional):**
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for options to add premium features with included API access.
